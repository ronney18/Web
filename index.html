	Description: This web page uses the mechanics of HTML such as the title,
	header of the page, paragraphs, and sub-headers. This web page also uses CSS
	to style my html page with color, borders, images, and graphics. To test
	these features, I talked about my experience at UMass Lowell, which school
	I transferred from, and how happy I was able to get into this class. I talked
	a little of myself. I also included a selfie for a description of myself.

	Validation: I used the Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/)
	and the CSS Validation Service http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.

					Hi! My name is Ronney Sanchez and I am a Computer Science major. I am glad to be in this course because I love making GUIs online and making my web page visible. This is my first time making a web page online. This is my second semester at UMass Lowell and I am becoming more advanced with these programs. I have experience with other programs as well such as C, C++, JAVA, and assembly. I spent plenty of time working with these languages.

						I am ready to do some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery because I love fancy web designs.
						I come from Lawrence, MA where I was born and raised. I attended Lawrence Family Development Charter School in middle school and Lawrence High School for high school.

					I used to go to Northern Essex Community College. I was studying the same major "Computer Science" and got an associates degree in the field. Luckily I was able to transfer to this school to go for a bachelors for another 2 years.
					Time went very fast for me throughout these college years.
