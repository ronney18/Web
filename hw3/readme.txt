There is no errors or warnings on my validation.

When I was doing this assignment, I had trouble with the navigation bar. The background color did not want to
cover the entire navigation alignment. It only cover partially on the navigation bar. Also the body background picture
covers about halfway of the HTML. I don't know if this is the way how it suppose to be because in the direction, it mentions
that the body bacground does not cover the html page, it only covers below the gradient.

Overall this assignment is very tricky will all the background style, the alignment, font color, content, etc.
I hope I did well on most of the content but there were a few problems that I went to.
