	Description: This web page uses the mechanics of HTML such as the title, header of the page, paragraphs, and sub-headers. This web page test the code for these features. To test these features, I talked about my experience at UMass Lowell, which school I transferred from, and how happy I was able to get into this class. I talked a little of myself.

		Introduction of Myself at UMass Lowell
	</h1>
	<p>
		Hi! My name is Ronney Sanchez and I am a Computer Science major. I am glad to be in this course because I love making GUIs online and making my web page visible. This is my first time making a web page online. This is my second semester at UMass Lowell and I am becoming more advanced with these programs. I have experience with other programs as well such as C, C++, JAVA, and assembly. I spent plenty of time working with these languages.

I am ready to do some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery because I love fancy web designs.

		I used to go to Northern Essex Community College. I was studying the same major "Computer Science" and got an associates degree in the field. Luckily I was able to transfer to this school to go for a bachelors for another 2 years.
