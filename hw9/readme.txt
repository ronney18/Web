HW9: Implementing a Bit of Scrabble with Drag-and-Drop

Based on my implementation, I got my tiles and rack to be displayed on the page. I got my tiles to be generated
at random and being displayed 7 at a time on the rack. However, there is only a few tiles from the scrabble tile array
that is having trouble to be displayed on the web page.

I got my score board working by tallying up every letter dropped on the blank boards and subtracted by removing it from
the board. Also my score calculation takes the account of the bonus board as well based on how much the score must be
multiply according to the bonus.
 
I believe that I got most of the component working with only a few bugs on the scrabble tiles.
