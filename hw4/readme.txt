I had trouble with the HTML5 Markup Validation Service. The W3C Markup Validation Service is complaining on the 
<meta charset="utf-8"> code. I don't think that the validator is recognizing this piece of code. Other than this code
there is no other errors on the validator.

With the W3C CSS Validation Service there is no errors on my CSS code. Everything works fine.
